>> git add . (to all files to the stage which are in the project)
>> git commit (to start to track all the files which are on the stage)
>> git restore --staged names.txt (to remove a file from stage)
>> git stash: Let's say you've made some changes after committing in the log, if you want to
    save those changes in a temporary directory and restore them later you can do that 
    using git stash pop. Otherwise, stashing gives you clean working tree just like you would 
    have got with the last log entry. git stash clean removes the stashed directory.
